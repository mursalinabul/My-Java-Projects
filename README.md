# My-Java-Projects
This is an assignment which I have competed in my 2nd semester CIS program. In this assignment I have integrated collections into the CIS  assignment software.  This activity required me to use a HashMap during coding of the login for the application.
I created a class called Login which contains a HashMap as a private instance attribute.  It should also have an instance method called loadCredentials which accepts as parameters the two arrays.  It will load the HashMap with key/value pairs based on the two arrays above. The userNames should be the keys and the passwords the values.  The purpose of the HashMap is to allow us to obtain the userâ€™s password given their username as the key.
I created an instance method called login in the Login class.  This method will prompt the user for a username and password. It will then return true or false based on whether the user enters a valid username and password.  Note that the username should exist and the password associated with that username should match what is stored for that username in the hashmap.
When the application starts create a Login object .  Call the method to ensure the credentials are loaded and pass the two arrays provided above to the method.  Then continually prompt the user to login until they enter a valid username and password.  Provide an error message if login fails.  Once a valid username and password is entered the main menu is shown to the user and the program runs normally.
